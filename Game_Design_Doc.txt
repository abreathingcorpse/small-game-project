===Project Description===
Thi game design document describes the details of a 2D top-down Trading Simulation/Strategy game,
which is intended for a Casual demographic.

The game's setting is the Middle Ages. The player will be controlling a character in order to
harvest resources and trade with other characters (NPCs).

===Storyline===
This is more of a minigame prototype, so there's no actual story.

---The Theme---
This game is about getting the most gold coins by the timer the timer from the game gets to 0.
It should be a game that people may pick up whenever they have about 10 minutes to kill
and would like to see if they can beat their own score.

---Progression---
There's no real progression here.
The game will have a single map only. Although the starting point could be randomized or,
at least, have well defined set of starting points and pick one of them to spawn the player at
the start of the game.

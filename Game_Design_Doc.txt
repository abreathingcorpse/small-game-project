#This Game Design Document is based on the sections given by Penaz91 on his 2DGD-F0TH project
===Project Description===
Thi game design document describes the details of a 2D top-down Trading Simulation/Strategy game,
which is intended for a Casual demographic.

The game's setting is the Middle Ages. The player will be controlling a character in order to
harvest resources and trade with other characters (NPCs).

The project will have only polygons as graphics.

===Characters===
This is more of a minigame prototype, so there's no actual story.

===Storyline===
This is more of a minigame prototype, so there's no actual story.

---The Theme---
This game is about getting the most gold coins by the time the timer from the game gets to 0.
It should be a game that people may pick up whenever they have about 10 minutes to kill
and would like to see if they can beat their own score.

---Progression---
There's no real progression here.
The game will have a single map only. Although the starting point could be randomized or,
at least, have well defined set of starting points and pick one of them to spawn the player at
the start of the game.

===Levels and Environments===
The game will contain a single hexmap. The map will have the resources on specific hexes.
The resources will have polygon based graphics. A stone will be a 4-sided gray irregular polygon,
while a Pine tree will be a brown rectangle with three green triangles on top. 

The player will need to move the character to the resources and start harvesting them.
When the character's load is full the player won't be able to harvest more resources and will
require to walk to the vendor to sell some items.

===Gameplay===

---Goals---
Long Term Goal: Beat his/her own highscore.
Short Term Goal: Optimize the way the character gets it's income.

---Game Mechanics---
There will be two resources: Timber & Stone.
A particular hex will have a random set of resources.
The amount of a timber or stone resource will appear next to the resource itself.
Timber will keep on increasing sporadically in correlation to the amount of timber on a hex,
up to a maximum amount. Stone won't increase.

Every time the player harvests a resource the number next to it will go down
and the character's capacity bar will be filled accordingly.
The capacity bar will only appear on the screen whenever the player harvests a resource or
when the player's capacity is full, which at this point will turn red and
won't leave the screen until it decreases.
The player can't harvest a resource when the bar is full. 

In order to decrease the character's capacity, the player will need to visit a vendor.
When the players sells resources his/her gold coins will increase and the capacity will be emptied.
The amount of money is dependant on the amount of resources brought to the vendor.

---Skills---
The player will need to press keyboard or Joypad buttons.
If a Joypad is used, then the player will need to use a Joystick as well.

---Items/Powerups---
The player will be able to the following upgrades by visiting his/her base (spawn location):
* Harvesting Speed.- The cooldown for harvesting resources is reduced.
* Speed.- The characters movement speed is increased.
* Capacity.- The character will be able to hold more items.

---Difficulty Management and Progression---
The game will become harder during a single run because the resources will become more and more
scarce.
During subsecuent runs, however, the game will become easier, since now the player will know
where the resources appear on the map. The difficulty for the player will be, to come up with
different strategies to optimize the gold coins that they have at the end of the run.

For instance, they could try to stop buying skills, since they will cost gold. Or to only harvest
timber after an x amount of minutes, in order to maximize the amount of timber they can get on a
single run. 

---Losing Conditions---
The game can be lost in the following ways:
* The player restarts the run or exits the game.
* The player could not beat his/her own highscore (Bad Ending).

===Graphic Style and Art===
The game will not have a background. In other words, it'll simply be a black background.
The art will consist of geometrical figures. The character will consist of two triangles.
With the exterior being filled and the interior one being unfilled, giving us an irregular
4-sided polygon which resembles an arrow.
The resources will have polygon based graphics as well. A stone will be a 4-sided gray
irregular polygon, while a Pine tree will be a brown rectangle with three green triangles on top. 

===Sound and Music===
The game won't have any music.
The game will have at least three sound effects in order to give some feedback to the player:
* The sound of a pickaxe hitting a rock.
* The sound of an axe hitting a tree.
* The sound of coins rattling.

===User Interface===
The game's main menu will consist of centered text. The currently selected option
will be highlighted.
The main menu will be composed of the following options:
* New Game.- Self explanatory, this is where the player starts a new run.
* Highscores.- This is where the player can see his/her highscores.
* Settings.- This is where the player can modify different settings, such as the Keyboard Mapping.
* Exit.- The player closes the game.

If the player presses the Start Button while on a run, then a similar menu will appear:
* Return.- Exits the Pause Menu.
* Highscores.- This is where the player can see his/her highscores.
* Settings.- This is where the player can modify different settings, such as the Keyboard Mapping.
* Abandon Run.- Return to the main menu. The score will not be saved.
* Exit Game.- The player closes the game.

The game will also show the current capacity bar whenever the player harvests a resource or when
it's capacity is full.

===Game Controls===
The main action the player will be doing is moving the character. Which will be done with the
WASD keys or the Left Joystick if a Joypad is used.

The player will also require some keys/buttons assigned for the following actions:
* Harvest a resource
* Select menu option
* Show pause menu
* Upgrade Harvesting Speed.
* Upgrade Speed.
* Upgrade Capacity. 

The default mappings may be updated by the player.

===Accessibility Options===
There won't be any. This is a prototype.

===Tools===
Text Editor: Vim
Framework: SFML
Version Control: GitHub
Art: Krita

===Marketing===
The game is intended to be a prototype. The first project to add to my portfolio, so that I can
show what I'm able to do.

---Target Audience---
People who could help me improve or people who would like me to show them my previous work.

---Available Platforms---
As a Linux user, I hate that there are so many great games out there without Linux support,
which is why my development philosophy will be Linux first. I'll be developing in Linux so,
the game will run there.
Since my target audience tipically uses Windows, the game must run on Windows 10 as well.

---Monetization---
This is a free prototype released under the GPL v3.

---Internationalization and Localization---
Although there won't be much text. The game will be in English.

===Other/Random Ideas===
The idea is to first develop something that works. In case the working prototype was developed
within a two month window, then we can start thinking of implementing one of these ideas.

* Local Multiplayer
* Random Resource locations, that is, the resources will be spawned randonmly, based on some
  defined rules, instead of being put there manually. Which would give some replayability, since
  the map would be different every run.
* Spawn more than one vendor.
- Random vendor spawn locations.
- Random buy prices, some vendors will pay more for wood, other will pay more for stone.
  Based on the amount of resources that they currently have in store.
* Have rare resources, for instance, silver ore, gold ore, etc.
- Develop a resource selling system, since the player might want to sell all of its timber to a
  specific vendor but, save his ores for another one.
* The character's speed will be slowed based on the current percentage capacity.
- Rework the Upgrades. One of the three should be something like: Strength.- Reduces the slow
  effect of the current capacity percentage.
  It could the a rework of the same Capacity stat, or the Speed stat.

  Perhaps the Harvesting Speed could be Upgraded to Strength.- Increases the damage done to the
  resources (more damage, more resources harvested) and reduces the slow effect of the current
  capacity percentage. If this is the case, perhaps the Speed stat could reduce the harvesting
  cooldown as well.

* Replace the black background from the game.
* Get an artist to replace the resources art.
* Get an artist to replace the character art.
* Add a song to the game.
* Replace both the Main Menu and the Pause Menu with ones that actually look good.
* Translate the little text there is to Spanish.
* Add a Start Animation when a New Game is started, similar to Mario Party's 
  "Start!" Voice/Animation.
- Add a similar Time Up animation.

#This Game Design Document is based on the sections given by Penaz91 on his 2DGD-F0TH project
===Project Description===
Thi game design document describes the details of a 2D top-down Trading Simulation/Strategy game,
which is intended for a Casual demographic.

The game's setting is the Middle Ages. The player will be controlling a character in order to
harvest resources and trade with other characters (NPCs).

The project will have only polygons as graphics.

===Characters===
This is more of a minigame prototype, so there's no actual story.

===Storyline===
This is more of a minigame prototype, so there's no actual story.

---The Theme---
This game is about getting the most gold coins by the timer the timer from the game gets to 0.
It should be a game that people may pick up whenever they have about 10 minutes to kill
and would like to see if they can beat their own score.

---Progression---
There's no real progression here.
The game will have a single map only. Although the starting point could be randomized or,
at least, have well defined set of starting points and pick one of them to spawn the player at
the start of the game.

===Levels and Environments===
The game will contain a single hexmap. The map will have the resources on specific hexes.
The resources will have polygon based graphics. A stone will be a 4-sided gray irregular polygon,
while a Pine tree will be a brown rectangle with three green triangles on top. 

The player will need to move the character to the resources and start harvesting them.
When the character's load is full the player won't be able to harvest more resources and will
require to walk to the vendor to sell some items.

===Gameplay===

---Goals---
Long Term Goal: Beat his/her own highscore.
Short Term Goal: Optimize the way the character gets it's income.

---Game Mechanics---
There will be two resources: Timber & Stone.
A particular hex will have a random set of resources.
The amount of a timber or stone resource will appear next to the resource itself.
Timber will keep on increasing sporadically in correlation to the amount of timber on a hex,
up to a maximum amount. Stone won't increase.

Every time the player harvests a resource the number next to it will go down
and the character's capacity bar will be filled accordingly.
The capacity bar will only appear on the screen whenever the player harvest a resource or
when the player's capacity if full, which at this point will turn red and
won't leave the screen until it decreases.
The player can't harvest a resource when the bar is full. 

In order to decrease the character's capacity, the player will need to visit a vendor.
When the players sells resources his/her gold coins will increase and the capacity will be emptied.
The amount of money is dependant on the amount of resources brought to the vendor.

---Skills---
The player will need to press keyboard or Joypad buttons.
If a Joypad is used, then the player will need to use a Joystick as well.

---Items/Powerups---
The player will be able to the following upgrades by visiting his/her base (spawn location):
* Harvesting Speed.- The cooldown for harvesting resources is reduced.
* Speed.- The characters movement speed is increased.
* Capacity,- The character will be able to hold more items.

---Difficulty Management and Progression---
The game will become harder during a single run because the resources will become more and more
scarce.
During subsecuent runs, however, the game will become easier, since now the player will know
where the resources appear on the map. The difficulty for the player will be, to come up with
different strategies to optimize the gold coins that they have at the end of the run.

For instance, they could try to stop buying skills, since they will cost gold. Or to only harvest
timber after an x amount of minutes, in order to maximize the amount of timber they can get on a
single run.
